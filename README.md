# Voice-Conversion-with-low-duration-audios
We converted British English Audios to Indian English Audios using CycleGAN-VC2 model. We used low duration audios as an experiment as GANs generally require high duration audios to train well. We used PESQ and MCD Scores to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the conversion respectively.
